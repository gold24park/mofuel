# Art

It's about time we give Cool Symbol a sprite instead of the default pink question mark. In order to do this, we need to create a PNG in our image editor of choice. The image _must_ be a PNG. The image also must no be more than 12 by 12 pixels for symbols and no more than 22 by 22 pixels for items.

We'll make Cool Symbol into a green smiley face:

We need to save this file in the `art` folder of our mod folder. We also need to make sure the PNG's name is the same as the type of our mod, in this case: `cool_symbol`:

And that's all we have to do!

In the next tutorial, we'll go over how to add sound effects to Cool Symbol:
