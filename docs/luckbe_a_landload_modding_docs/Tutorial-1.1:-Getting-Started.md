# Getting Started

In order to make and upload Mods to the Steam Workshop, we'll need to make use of the Mod Uploader. The application is in the same directory as the Luck be a Landlord application. We can easily access it by right-clicking Luck be a Landlord in our Steam library, and clicking **Browse local files**.

This will open the directory where we need to run the Uploader:

Once the uploader is open, we're going to make use of the **Create New Mod** button.

This will create a blank Mod for us that we can view by pressing the **Open Mod Directory** button.

(At this point, we can close the Uploader application for the time being)

Find that folder that we created (**My Cool Mod** by default). This folder will contain all the files we'll be uploading to the Steam Workshop so other players can enjoy our Mod!

In the next tutorial, we'll make a basic custom symbol:
